* Problem Encountered during development of Computer AI
* Code should be finished, but have no way to test changes
* Solution: Made temporary methods to test the game with, that output to command line

* Problem Encountered: algorithm was not working, had trouble debugging
* Solution: split the algorithm up into a bunch of different methods.

* Tons of weird errors revolving around the Cell class
* Discovered that there is already a Cell class in javafx, and some of our code was referencing that
* instead of our cell class
* Solution: rename Cell to GameCell

* Cells not drawing
*

TRAVIS

* could not get cells in pane 3 to display 

easy mode doesn't seem to be working, the computer doesn't place its tokens.
